#summary How to use it with ActionScript 2.

We created some classes in our [http://code.google.com/p/lbi-useful-actionscript-2/ Actionscript 2 Library] to easily use the logger features.

The main class is *com.lbi.debug.Log* which uses a couple of Enumeration classes.

The classes are not commented because of their simple behaviours. The [http://lbi-useful-actionscript-2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/LBiUseful/project/test/debug/LogTest.as test cases] might be of help in the case.
