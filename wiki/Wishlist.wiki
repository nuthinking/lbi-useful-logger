#summary List of features we would like to have.

  * Possibility to filter the output through radio buttons â€“ like Xray to set a kind of debug level ();
  * Possibility to concatenate the logs of different tests, but also the possibility to show the log file as it is (like FlashTracer does)
  * If we trace Arrays or Objects, make them foldable in the view
  * Create support Classes for other programming languages (Java, C++)?
